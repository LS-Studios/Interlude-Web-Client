# **App Name**: Interlude Link Converter

## Core Features:

- Link Conversion: Converts user-inputted links using the interlude.api.leshift.de/convert API, displaying results in a dialog. It acts as a tool and checks if each entry from the provider contains all details necessary.
- Supported Providers: Displays a grid of supported providers fetched from the interlude.api.leshift.de/providers API, including logos.
- Link Interaction: Clicking a converted link navigates to the URL; long-pressing copies the link to the clipboard.
- History Screen: A history screen stores locally all converted links during the session, displaying them in the same row format. Clicking re-opens the conversion dialog.
- Settings Screen: Settings screen allows users to change the theme (light/dark), language (English, German), and clear the session history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light gray (#D1DEE8) serves as the foundation, offering a clean and neutral aesthetic while harmonizing seamlessly with both light and dark themes.
- Background color: Extremely light gray (#F8FAFC) to enhance readability and content focus.
- Accent color: Blue (#1A94E5) for interactive elements and key actions, providing a clear visual cue.
- Text color: White (#FFFFFF) in dark mode and Dark Gray (#0D171C) in light mode to ensure optimal readability across both themes.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headlines and body text. This pairing ensures a modern, neutral look suitable for clear communication.
- Use rounded cards and a centralized layout to achieve a simple yet modern design, emphasizing a user-friendly interface.
- Employ minimalistic icons for providers and actions to maintain a clean, focused user interface.
